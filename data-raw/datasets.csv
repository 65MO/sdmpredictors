WorldClim;TRUE;FALSE;http://www.worldclim.org/;WorldClim is a set of global climate layers (climate grids). Note that all data has been transformed back to real values, so there is no need to e.g. divide temperature layers by 10.;Hijmans, R.J., S.E. Cameron, J.L. Parra, P.G. Jones and A. Jarvis, 2005. Very high resolution interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas. International Journal of Climatology 25: 1965-1978.
Bio-ORACLE;FALSE;TRUE;http://www.oracle.ugent.be/;Bio-ORACLE is a set of GIS rasters providing marine environmental information for global-scale applications. It offers an array of geophysical, biotic and climate data at a spatial resolution 5 arcmin (9.2 km) in the ESRI ascii format.;Tyberghein L., Verbruggen H., Pauly K., Troupin C., Mineur F. & De Clerck O. Bio-ORACLE: a global environmental dataset for marine species distribution modeling. Global Ecology and Biogeography. http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2011.00656.x
MARSPEC;FALSE;TRUE;http://marspec.org/;MARSPEC is a set of high resolution climatic and geophysical GIS data layers for the world ocean. Seven geophysical variables were derived from the SRTM30_PLUS high resolution bathymetry dataset.  These layers characterize the horizontal orientation (aspect), slope, and curvature of the seafloor and the distance from shore.  Ten “bioclimatic” variables were derived from NOAA’s World Ocean Atlas and NASA’s MODIS satellite imagery and characterize the inter-annual means, extremes, and variances in sea surface temperature and salinity.  All variables are available as ESRI raster grids at a 30 arc-second spatial resolution (also known as “1 km” grids) and use a common land mask.  These variables will be useful to those interested in the spatial ecology of marine shallow-water and surface-associated pelagic organisms across the globe. Note that, in contrary to the original MARSPEC, all layers have unscaled values.;Sbrocco, EJ and Barber, PH (2013) MARSPEC: Ocean climate layers for marine spatial ecology.
